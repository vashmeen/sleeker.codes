      <p>Sleeker (for now) use <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/colors">Radix Colors</a> under the hood.</p>
      <p>Radix colors are a color pallet with 20 scales. It is built with accessibility in mind.</p>
      <p>Also dark mode works out of the box.</p>
      <p>Sleeker (for now follows the same API as Radix)</p>
      <p>Breaking Change warning: in case we come up with a better color solution, there is chance of breaking changes.</p>
